Learning project: Calculator

*!*Classic Ultra Realistic Calculator*!*



Built with:

Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- vanilla JavaScript

Tools:

- VisualStudio Code
- Linux CLI
- Git & GitHub

What I've learned:

- Using alternatives to global variables.
- Creating an input overlay for a photo-realistic object.
- CSS Grid experience for button layout.
- more JavaScript practice - including: event delegation, using literal object to hold main variables, logic/conditional practice.
- creating a realistic aesthetic with CSS.
- testing for and handling unexpected user input.
- writing succinct, organised code?

My thoughts on the project:

- Not using eval() due to security risk adds some complexity.
- The buttonHandler function turned into a conditional nightmare, need to work on writing conditionals more logically and succinctly.
- I'm very happy with the aesthetic.
- Using a literal object to store the main variables is probably not the best way to go.
- Still has a copuple of minor bugs...
